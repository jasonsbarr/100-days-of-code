# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Built JavaScript30 day one project: JavaScript Drum Kit and the index page for my whole JS30 run.

**Thoughts:** There was nothing difficult about any of it conceptually, but it's good to start stretching my code muscles again even if it's just with a simple project.
